This repository contains useful algorithms to solve
general problems that arise in computer science.

Contents: 

graphs.py: Contains common graph algorithms which
manipulate a dictionary data structure which represents a graph, 
as well as a class which abstracts many different graph search
problems, and is reusable with many different goal tests and 
successor functions

arrays.py: Contains common array manipulation and sorting algorithms
implemented in a number of different styles

search.py: Contains implementations of breadth first and depth first 
search working on a standard formatted search problem.

rosalindSolutions.py: Contains the parsing functions and the algorithm
calls needed to solve problems of larger size than a typical command
line input function. The typical graph is assumed to be in edge list
format, and arrays are represented by an order, a newline, and then a string
of values.
